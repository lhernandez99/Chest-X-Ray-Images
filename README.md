# Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-Ray Images using CNN

This project applies a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify chest X-ray images as either **NORMAL** or **PNEUMONIA**. The goal is to develop a deep learning model that can assist in early detection of pneumonia from radiographic images.

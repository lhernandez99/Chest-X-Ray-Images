## Project Goal

Early diagnosis of pneumonia is critical for effective treatment. Automating detection using deep learning can assist radiologists and reduce diagnostic delays, especially in resource-limited settings.

## Project Overview

This project applies a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify chest X-ray images as either **NORMAL** or **PNEUMONIA**. The goal is to develop a deep learning model that can assist in early detection of pneumonia from radiographic images.

**Task Type**: Supervised learning â€” Binary classification (Normal vs. Pneumonia)
